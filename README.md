## 🌟 Features

### 🎯 Core Functionalities

- **Mood-Based Suggestions**: Users can get recipes tailored to their psychological state (e.g., sad → comforting food).
- **Smart Ingredient Filter**: Suggests recipes based on ingredients users already have at home.
- **Multi-language Support**: Fully localized interface and recipe data in **English**, **French**, and **Arabic**.

## 🧠 Scientific Foundation

The mood-based recommendations are inspired by studies in **Eating Psychology** and **Behavioral Nutrition**, particularly:

- _"The Influence of Emotional States on Food Choice"_ by Macht (2008)
- _"Mood and Food Consumption"_ – Journal of Health Psychology
- _"Comfort Food Preferences and Psychological Relief"_ – Health Communication Journal

These studies show clear correlations between mood and food cravings (e.g., stressed people often crave carbs, anxious people need calming herbs like chamomile, etc.). MoodBite Kitchen uses this data to curate recipe types that align with user states.
